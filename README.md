# GiphyLookup

![main workflow](https://github.com/nspavlo/Chili/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

ðŸ§™ Welcome Traveler!

## Getting Started
**GiphyLookup** uses [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) to manage build dependencies and [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint) ðŸŒ± to install and run [Swift Lint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) and [Swift Format](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat).

## Installation
Launch `GiphyLookup.xcodeproj` and run the `GiphyLookupApplication` scheme on a simulator or iOS device.

> ðŸš¨ Usually I would create a separate `Secrets.xcconfig` that's added to `.gitignore` to store secrets w/o exposing them to the internet. For this assignment `api_key` is included in the source. My âš½ was to reduce any additional steps needed to build and run the project.

## Main Modules
Application is separated in two schemes:
-  GiphyLookup
-  GiphyLookupApplication 

> This way, bigness logic stays platform agnostic, modular and fast to build and test. On every pull-reuqest, both modules will be built and tested.

## Data

Unfortunately, the data from bakend APIs isnâ€™t always perfect. By default `JSONDecoder` will discard the whole collection when one of the elements are corrupted. To improve on this, application uses generic `LossyArray<T>` wrapper.

Some custom data types are introduced in order to remove assumtions about behaviour.
```swift
public struct SearchQuery {
    let value: String

    public init?(_ string: String?) {
        guard let string, !string.isEmpty else {
            return nil
        }

        value = string
    }
}
```
For example `SearchQuery` is used instead of plain `String`.

## Contributing

We canâ€™t always see our own blind spots, and itâ€™s a gift to have them pointed out by another perspective. 

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
